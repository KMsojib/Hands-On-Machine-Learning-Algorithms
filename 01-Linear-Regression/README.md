## 🔑 Key Concepts
- Models the relationship between `X` and `Y` as a straight line.
- Equation:  
  \[
  y = wX + b
  \]
- Parameters: Weights `w` and bias `b`.

## 🎯 Mini Project: House Price Prediction
- **Dataset:** Boston Housing (or Kaggle House Prices dataset).
- **Goal:** Predict house prices based on features like rooms, area, location.
- **Steps:**
  1. Load dataset  
  2. Train/Test split  
  3. Train model with Linear Regression  
  4. Evaluate using RMSE, R²  
  5. Visualize predictions vs actual values
